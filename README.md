OBJECTIVE:
COLLIDE WITH AS MANY TITANS AS POSSIBLE

HINTS:

1.) fire monsters respawn at bottom of screen so
do not get hit there or you will keep losing lives

2.) You cannot get hit when player/pet is at the water and torches

3.) More stars collected = more titans to kill = easier to gain points

4.) More batmen spawn each time you lose a life
