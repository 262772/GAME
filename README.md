OBJECTIVE:
COLLIDE WITH AS MANY TITANS AS POSSIBLE

CHARACTERS:

knight = player that needs to collide with "titan" monsters to increase score
dog = pet that collects powerups for player
fire_monster = enemy
batman = enemy
star = collectable for power-up
titan = collectable for score

HINTS:

1.) fire monsters respawn at bottom of screen so
do not get hit there or you will keep losing lives

2.) You cannot get hit when player/pet is at the water and torches

3.) More stars collected = more titans to kill = easier to gain points

4.) More batmen spawn each time you lose a life
